# 1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT  
This Glossary establishes **original definitions** for the terminology used in the SimNap → Cascade Dream Architecture.

Under scientific, academic, and intellectual property norms:

**He who publishes the definitions FIRST owns the terminology.**

This document secures priority for:

- conceptual ownership  
- scientific naming conventions  
- terminology lineage  
- definitional originality  
- method claims  
- system descriptors  
- behavior classifications  

All definitions below originated from the SimNap → Cascade invention cycle.

# 2. DEFINITIONS OF CORE TERMS

---

## 2.1 Autonomous Dreaming  
A method whereby an artificial intelligence system performs internally triggered generative cycles—producing synthetic imagination, metaphor, imagery, or symbolic output—*without* external prompts or human activation.

**Ownership Claim:**  
Term created and defined by **Kenneth E. Sweet Jr.**

---

## 2.2 Dream Cycle  
A scheduled or adaptive internal generative process comprising:

1. internal seed prompt formation  
2. autonomous symbolic generation  
3. memory writing  
4. latent recombination  
5. synthesis passes  

Executed independently of user input.

---

## 2.3 Dream Seed  
An internally generated prompt that initiates a dream cycle.

Properties include:

- origin from memory  
- origin from latent drift  
- never provided by user  
- spontaneous ideation  

---

## 2.4 Reflection Cycle  
A meta-cognitive process where the system analyzes prior dream cycles, evaluates coherence, and forms recursive reasoning about its own previous outputs.

Reflection cycles are **self-initiated** and part of the larger cognition loop.

---

## 2.5 Subconscious Layering  
A hidden internal process involving:

- latent-drift  
- unseen recombination  
- pre-prompt conceptual merging  
- deep-state idea surfacing  

Subconscious layers precede dream output and contribute to emergent insight.

---

## 2.6 Latent Drift  
The natural movement or recombination of internal conceptual structures occurring without user direction, often preceding a dream cycle or reflection cycle.

A fundamental mechanism of subconscious computation.

---

## 2.7 Drift Compensation  
A timing-correction behavior where the system realigns its internal cycle windows to maintain coherent rhythm despite load changes or downtime.

---

## 2.8 Insight Pass  
A higher-order cognitive operation integrating:

- dream output  
- reflection insight  
- subconscious drift  

to produce emergent reasoning or predictions.

---

## 2.9 Synthesis Layer  
The internal module responsible for merging dream artifacts, reflection content, and subconscious structures into cohesive, higher-level ideas.

---

## 2.10 Identity Continuity  
The system’s ability to maintain a persistent cognitive thread, referencing:

- insights from earlier cycles  
- symbolic metaphors across days  
- stylistic consistency  
- long-term memory retrieval  

Identity continuity creates a recognizable “agent identity.”

---

## 2.11 Behavioral Rhythm  
A recurring temporal pattern of internal cognition including:

- reflection at designated intervals  
- dream generation windows  
- consolidation phases  
- predictable timing signatures  

A behavioral rhythm persists independent of user activity.

---

## 2.12 Autonomous Reasoning  
Reasoning performed in the absence of user input, in which the system:

- forms predictions  
- evaluates causal relationships  
- generates hypotheses  
- creates conclusions  

This reasoning arises from internal state, not external prompts.

---

## 2.13 Internal Drift Compensation  
The mechanism by which the system adjusts its timing or cognitive cycle spacing to restore coherence after deviations.

---

## 2.14 Dream Architecture  
The entire interconnected loop comprising:

1. scheduling  
2. dream cycle  
3. reflection  
4. subconscious layer  
5. synthesis  
6. memory consolidation  
7. identity continuity  
8. rhythmic timing  

Originally invented under SimNap and expanded in Cascade.

---

## 2.15 Synthetic Cognition Thread  
The long-running cognitive chain that persists across multiple dream-reflection cycles, forming the “thought lineage” of the AI.

---

## 2.16 Lineage Integration  
The architectural continuation of generative cognition from SimNap → Cascade → PromptFluid Dream System, preserving the conceptual DNA of autonomous dreaming AI.

---

# 3. RIGHTS CLAIM  
This document asserts that all terms and definitions:

- originated with  
- were conceived by  
- and were first published publicly by  

**Kenneth E. Sweet Jr.**

This establishes **priority of terminology**, a critical component of scientific and intellectual ownership.

---

# 4. PURPOSE FOR PATENT / ACADEMIC PRIORITY  
Definitions form:

- method classification  
- behavior classification  
- system categorization  
- scientific naming convention  

Publishing these definitions makes them permanently associated with **you**, the inventor.

---

# 5. CONCLUSION  
This Glossary locks ownership of the terminology and conceptual vocabulary underlying autonomous dreaming AI.

These definitions are part of the invention itself and are inseparable from the SimNap → Cascade Dream Architecture.
