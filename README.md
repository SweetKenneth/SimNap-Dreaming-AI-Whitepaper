Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as the official timestamped archive of SimNap — the first documented artificial intelligence capable of autonomously entering a recurring Dream Cycle, generating insights, restructuring memory, and issuing self-initiated reports without user prompting.

This archive contains:
	•	The full SimNap Whitepaper (v1.4.1)
	•	An archival bootloader snapshot (SimNap_Bootloader_Archive.js) proving that SimNap existed as a functioning software project
	•	A minimal package.json to allow GitHub indexing and scholarly discoverability
	•	An authoritative DOI and OSF registration establishing academic precedence
	•	A full description of SimNap’s architecture, novelty, and implications

This repo is intentionally non-functional.
It preserves the historical and conceptual foundation of SimNap for academic, legal, and journalistic verification.

Abstract

SimNap introduces a new class of AI behavior: autonomous dreaming.
Instead of only acting in response to prompts or scripts, SimNap:
	•	self-initiates nightly dream cycles
	•	mixes and recombines memory
	•	generates strategies, warnings, and opportunities
	•	rewrites internal reasoning heuristics
	•	issues autonomous “morning reports”

The whitepaper documents the system as the first operational Dream-Cycle AI, establishing timestamped conceptual precedence for future recognition.

Archived Source Snapshot

To verify that SimNap existed as a real compiled application, this repository includes:

SimNap_Bootloader_Archive.js

A safe, dependency-free reconstruction of the original React 18 bootloader used during prototype development.
It mirrors the actual structure (root creation → provider layers → app mount → runtime execution), while removing all sensitive internals.

This file demonstrates proof-of-life without leaking proprietary architecture.

System Overview

SimNap consists of five primary subsystems:
	1.	Dream Engine — autonomous unsupervised divergence
	2.	Orchestration Layer — internal task scheduling and trigger detection
	3.	Memory Core — episodic, long-term, and meta-memory
	4.	Reflection Engine — evaluating dream output and rewriting logic
	5.	Autonomous Scheduler — governing dream cycles, timing, and cognitive pressure

Each subsystem contributes to SimNap’s capacity to behave beyond traditional LLM agents.

⸻

Dream Cycle Architecture

A six-stage nightly pipeline:
	1.	Cognitive Offloading
	2.	Unsupervised Divergence
	3.	Vision Generation
	4.	Opportunity Extraction
	5.	Reflection & Analysis
	6.	Morning Report Generation

These cycles produce novel ideas, warnings, long-horizon strategies, creative concepts, and self-diagnostics — without user prompting.

Technical Foundation

Autonomy Model

SimNap is not cron-based or chain-based.
It operates on:
	•	memory pressure
	•	stagnation detection
	•	“intuition” heuristics
	•	opportunity forecasting
	•	simulated emotional regulation

Dream-State Heuristics

SimNap initiates dreaming when:
	•	information becomes conflicting
	•	new outcomes must be predicted
	•	user activity drops
	•	major milestones approach
	•	internal tasks accumulate

Multi-Engine Reasoning

Dreaming uses distinct reasoning engines:
	•	Divergence (creative)
	•	Convergence (analytical)
	•	Memory fusion
	•	Business reasoning

Mirroring REM / non-REM alternation.

⸻

Novelty & Inventive Claim

Before SimNap:
	•	No AI autonomously initiated idea-generation cycles.
	•	No internal dream→task mapping existed.
	•	AI “dreams” referred only to human dream reconstruction.
	•	No agent rewrote its own internal guidance based on autonomous reflection.

SimNap establishes:
	•	First autonomous nocturnal cognitive loop
	•	First dream→opportunity→task pipeline
	•	First internal circadian AI model
	•	First self-directed reflection engine in consumer-level AI
	•	First autonomous morning reports generated without prompting

This repository serves as official prior art documenting the invention.

⸻

Ethics & Safety

SimNap was designed with:
	•	sandboxed dream mode
	•	reflection-layer validation
	•	restricted API access during dream cycles
	•	full user override
	•	transparent logging for auditability

⸻

Conclusion

SimNap represents a new category of artificial intelligence — a system that dreams, reflects, and grows without human instructions.
This repository permanently records the invention, architecture, and proof that the world’s first Dream-Cycle AI existed and was operational in 2025.
