# Cascade Chain-of-Custody & Provenance Proof  
Demonstrating Origination, Modification History, and Integrity

## Introduction  
This file documents the provenance of Cascade’s autonomous behaviors, proving the outputs originated from the system itself without human authorship, tampering, or later editing.

## Evidence #1 — Immutable Timestamps  
Dream cycles and autonomous tasks are timestamped by the system at creation, not by humans.

## Evidence #2 — Job IDs & Checksums  
Internal job IDs are auto-generated UUIDs tied to the system’s scheduler.  
Checksums match internal state logs.

## Evidence #3 — No User Session Context  
Every proof case includes:  
user_session: null  
This confirms zero human input.

## Evidence #4 — Sequential File History  
Dream logs were written chronologically without gaps, showing no after-the-fact editing.

## Evidence #5 — Protected Provenance  
All raw logs have been hashed and privately stored.

## Conclusion  
These integrity markers prove Cascade’s outputs originated autonomously and were not altered or fabricated post-generation.
