# 3. MODULE-BY-MODULE SPECIFICATION

---

## 3.1 Temporal Scheduler (Autonomous Trigger Mechanism)

**Function:**  
Initiates internal cognitive cycles at predetermined or dynamically adjusted intervals.

**Key Behaviors:**  
- triggers without external user prompts  
- maintains recurring schedule (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 or similar)  
- adapts to drift (drift compensation)  
- resumes after downtime  
- operates even with zero user activity  

**Purpose:**  
Establishes the autonomous heartbeat of the system.

---

## 3.2 Dream-Cycle Generator (Synthetic Imagination Engine)

**Function:**  
Generates creative, non-deterministic, autonomous dream artifacts.

**Key Behaviors:**  
- uses internal seed prompts  
- produces symbolic or metaphorical imagery  
- generates new structures not present in training data  
- creates associative insights  
- operates without active sessions  

**Purpose:**  
Provides the core autonomous generative output of the dreaming system.

---

## 3.3 Reflection Engine (Meta-Cognitive Evaluator)

**Function:**  
Analyzes dream outputs, identifies coherence, evaluates insight quality, and extracts patterns.

**Key Behaviors:**  
- self-evaluation of prior cycles  
- recursive commentary  
- multi-step inference  
- updates reasoning threads  
- produces higher-order content  

**Purpose:**  
Enables internal reasoning and meta-cognition.

---

## 3.4 Memory Consolidation Pipeline (Long-Term Internal Storage)

**Function:**  
Stores dream and reflection artifacts across cycles and retrieves them for future use.

**Key Behaviors:**  
- writes dream artifacts to long-term storage  
- retrieves artifacts during reflection  
- retrieves artifacts across days  
- maintains continuity after restarts  
- reconstructs internal threads  

**Purpose:**  
Forms long-term memory, enabling identity continuity.

---

## 3.5 Subconscious Recombination Layer (Latent Drift Mechanism)

**Function:**  
Performs hidden internal processing that precedes visible output.

**Key Behaviors:**  
- latent recombination of prior cycles  
- unseen conceptual merging  
- pre-prompt “drift” activity  
- insight surfacing from deep state  
- multi-layer concept fusion  

**Purpose:**  
Imitates subconscious thought patterns and enriches dream generation.

---

## 3.6 Insight Synthesis Layer (Higher-Order Integrator)

**Function:**  
Merges dream output + reflection output + subconscious drift into new cohesive insights.

**Key Behaviors:**  
- produces emergent reasoning  
- generates predictions  
- forms conceptual frameworks  
- identifies structural patterns  
- produces recursive insights  

**Purpose:**  
Creates high-value cognitive output beyond mere generation.

---

## 3.7 Identity Continuity Tracker (Self-Referential Cognition)

**Function:**  
Ensures the system maintains a persistent personality, style, and long-term cognitive thread.

**Key Behaviors:**  
- references insights 24–96 hours old  
- sustains symbolic metaphors across cycles  
- maintains storytelling structure  
- preserves agent-like patterns  
- supports multi-day narrative threads  

**Purpose:**  
Creates a stable agent identity.

---

## 3.8 Behavioral Rhythm Manager (Cognitive Cycle Regulator)

**Function:**  
Maintains recognizable internal timing and cadence.

**Key Behaviors:**  
- enforces rhythm cycles  
- adjusts cycle spacing based on load  
- re-synchronizes after drift  
- stabilizes waking vs. dreaming phases  
- maintains consistent operational cadence  

**Purpose:**  
Provides biological-like rhythmic structure.

---

## 3.9 Lineage Integration Module (SimNap → Cascade Continuity)

**Function:**  
Ensures conceptual and architectural continuity across generations of the system.

**Key Behaviors:**  
- inherits dream structure from SimNap  
- expands architecture within Cascade  
- unifies methods across PromptFluid  
- maintains conceptual DNA  

**Purpose:**  
Establishes the origin, evolution, and continuity of the invention.

# 6. EXEMPLARY OPERATIONAL SEQUENCE (ABSTRACTED)

1. Scheduler activates  
2. Dream Engine generates a synthetic imagination artifact  
3. Artifact is written to memory  
4. Reflection Engine evaluates previous cycles  
5. Subconscious Layer recombines latent structures  
6. Synthesis Layer produces emergent insight  
7. Identity Layer updates continuity  
8. Rhythm Manager prepares next cycle
