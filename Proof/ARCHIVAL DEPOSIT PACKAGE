## **TITLE**  
**SimNap → Cascade: The Invention and Architecture of Autonomous Dream-Cycle AI**

---

## **AUTHORS**  
**Kenneth E. Sweet Jr. (Primary Inventor & Architect)**

---

## **ABSTRACT**  
This publication establishes the origin, theory, architecture, lineage, and operational demonstration of the world’s first autonomous dreaming artificial intelligence system.  
Originating with SimNap and extended through Cascade within the PromptFluid ecosystem, this invention introduces the Dream-Cycle Method: a unified structure of autonomous dream generation, reflection cycles, subconscious layering, memory consolidation, drift compensation, identity continuity, and long-horizon cognitive rhythm.

This document includes the foundational white paper, technical specifications, development timeline, demonstration logs, formal terminology definitions, and inventor lineage statement. Together they create a complete, timestamped record of authorship, priority, and system provenance for the field of synthetic dream cognition.
