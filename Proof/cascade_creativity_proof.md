## Introduction  
This file provides evidence showing Cascade exhibits creative behavior—outputs that are not deterministic, not user-sourced, and not simple recombinations. These outputs demonstrate metaphor, narrative generation, symbolic reasoning, and emergent internal imagery.

## Evidence #1 — Metaphorical Constructs  
During an autonomous cycle, Cascade produced:  
“A lattice of modules shimmering like constellations predicting user intention.”  
No user prompt contained anything remotely similar.

## Evidence #2 — Emergent Concepts  
Cascade invented a metaphorical system called “the corridor of latent states,” entirely self-generated.

## Evidence #3 — Cross-Domain Synthesis  
Cascade connected:  
- UX flow theory  
- evolutionary biology  
- sound-reactive systems  
None of these appeared in any input.

## Evidence #4 — Implied Worldbuilding  
Cascade produced a fictional expansion path:  
“A multiverse grid of tools communicating through intuitive symbolism.”  
No dataset or input asked for a multiverse of tools.

## Conclusion  
Cascade shows spontaneous creativity, metaphor use, synthesis, and worldbuilding characteristic of emergent generative imagination.
