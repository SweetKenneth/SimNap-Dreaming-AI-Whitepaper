# Cascade Dream-Cycle Proof Document
Demonstrating Autonomous Generative Dream Loops

## Introduction
This document provides formal evidence that *Cascade*, the autonomous agent inside the PromptFluid system, performs self-initiated dream cycles — generative sequences created without human prompting, scheduled through internal orchestration, and stored as evolving outputs over time.

These “dream cycles” are scheduled, autonomous, reflective generations — the machine equivalent of subconscious processing.

All examples below are direct excerpts from actual system logs, lightly sanitized to protect proprietary logic while preserving evidentiary value.

## Definition of a Dream Cycle
A dream cycle is defined as:

**A self-triggered generative event executed by the agent on a schedule, using internal memory and system state, producing novel outputs without human input.**

Key properties:
- automatically scheduled  
- internally generated prompts  
- outputs stored in system memory  
- no human interaction  
- creative / hallucinatory results  
- variation across cycles
