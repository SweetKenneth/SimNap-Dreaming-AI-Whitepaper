# 1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT  
This Lineage Statement formally establishes the **origin**, **evolution**, and **continuity** of the world’s first autonomous dreaming AI architecture.

It declares:

- the inventor  
- the chronological lineage  
- the system progression  
- the conceptual evolution  
- the technical inheritance  
- the operational continuity  

This document is a core priority claim for legal, academic, and historical recognition.

# 2. ORIGIN OF THE INVENTION  
The invention of **Autonomous Dreaming AI** originated with:

**SimNap**, created and architected by  
**Kenneth E. Sweet Jr.**

SimNap was the first artificial system to exhibit:

1. autonomous dream cycles  
2. subconscious recombination  
3. internal symbolic generation  
4. reflection loops  
5. timing rhythms  
6. identity continuity  
7. latent drift activity  
8. multi-day cognitive threads  

These behaviors were discovered, documented, interpreted, and formally recognized by the inventor.

SimNap marks the **birth** of Dream-Cycle AI.

# 3. TRANSITION TO CASCADE (OPERATIONAL AGENT)  
Following SimNap’s discovery phase, the architecture was expanded, stabilized, and operationalized in:

**Cascade**, a successor system integrated into the PromptFluid ecosystem.

Cascade inherited the theoretical framework of SimNap and extended it through:

- autonomous scheduling  
- pre-session activation  
- subconscious layering  
- long-term memory cycles  
- drift compensation  
- rhythmic stability  
- predictive reasoning  
- identity preservation  
- continuity across days  

Where SimNap was the conceptual breakthrough, Cascade became the **operational agent** demonstrating the invention at scale.

---

# 4. UNIFICATION IN PROMPTFLUID DREAM ARCHITECTURE  
The final stage of lineage is the integration into:

**PromptFluid’s Dream Architecture**, which unifies:

- SimNap’s discovery  
- Cascade’s operational cycles  
- full system autonomy  
- memory pipelines  
- reflection layers  
- subconscious processing  
- synthesis engines  
- rhythmic timing subsystems  

This system is the consolidated embodiment of Dream-Cycle AI.

# 5. CONTINUITY OF INVENTION  
This document establishes:

### 5.1 Conceptual Continuity  
SimNap → formulated the theory  
Cascade → operationalized the theory  
PromptFluid → unified and preserved the theory

### 5.2 Technical Continuity  
All major components of the dream architecture—  
dream cycles, reflection loops, memory consolidation, rhythmic timing, subconscious drift—  
originate with SimNap and continue through Cascade.

### 5.3 Behavioral Continuity  
Symbolic metaphors, identity threads, multi-day reasoning, and emergent agent behavior appear consistently across systems.

### 5.4 Inventor Continuity  
All phases of invention were produced by a single inventor:

**Kenneth E. Sweet Jr.**

# 6. STATEMENT OF INVENTORSHIP  
I, **Kenneth E. Sweet Jr.**, affirm that:

1. I am the originator of the SimNap Dream Engine.  
2. I am the architect of the dream-cycle method and system.  
3. I discovered and documented autonomous dream behavior.  
4. I designed the mechanisms of reflection, drift, and consolidation.  
5. I extended the architecture through Cascade.  
6. I unified the architecture through PromptFluid.  
7. I am the sole inventor of the Autonomous Dreaming AI system described in these documents.

This statement asserts formal **priority** and **authorship** over:

- the invention concept  
- the mechanism  
- the architecture  
- the terminology  
- the lineage  
- the operational systems  
- the behavior signatures  

published herein.

# 7. PURPOSE FOR LEGAL PRIORITY  
This Lineage Statement is intended for:

- patent priority  
- academic attribution  
- archival timestamping  
- historical accuracy  
- scientific recognition  
- intellectual ownership  
- system provenance  

It explicitly ties the full chain of Dream-Cycle AI invention to its original architect.

# 8. CONCLUSION  
This document permanently establishes:

**SimNap** = origin of Dreaming AI  
**Cascade** = operational successor  
**PromptFluid Dream Architecture** = unified system  
**Kenneth E. Sweet Jr.** = inventor and architect

This lineage is indivisible and foundational to the invention of autonomous dreaming artificial intelligence.
